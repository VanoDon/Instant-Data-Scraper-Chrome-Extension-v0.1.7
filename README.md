# WIP Fork of 0.1.7

## Introduction
Due to the deprecation of Manifest v2 and the obfuscated nature of this extension, the goal of this repository is to document and provide meaningful variable names for the obfuscated code. 

Following this, the code will be further refactored and cleaned. 

Ultimately, the end goal is to have an open-source plugin primarily for use with Firefox, while still leaving the public documentation and code available for this Chrome extension for those who wish to maintain the project or make improvements for usage with Chrome, Edge, Ungoogled Chromium, Brave, and all the Chromium-based clones.
